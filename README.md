# IntelliJ Tips and Tricks
Talk about the motivation. Time is important and 
we want to spend less time doing menial tasks. Mention Matt motivation.

## Key Mappings:
An effective way to minimize your coding time to touch your mouse as infrequently as possible. Learning keyboard shortcuts accomplishes this.

## Text Navigation:
Before we get into IntelliJ specific commands
let's discuss basic text navigation.

### Moving between words
```
Ctrl + →  // Windows
Alt  + →  // MacOS
```
### Moving to the end of lines
```
CMD  + →  // MacOS
```
### Selecting text
```
Ctrl + Shift + →  // Windows
Alt  + Shift + →  // MacOS
```

## IntelliJ Basics:
Now that we've gotten the text navigation basics out of the way, we can jump into the IntelliJ specifics.

### Intellisense
When IntelliJ boots up, it indexes all the files, classes, and jars associated with the project. This allows the tool to provide predictions about
what you want to type.

### Smart suggestions
```
Alt + Enter
```
Let Smart suggestions become your best friend while using IntelliJ. Whenever IntelliJ highlights
your code, it's usually warning you that you have a mistake. Let Smart suggestions assist you with correcting this. The suggestion also present you alternative ways to express your code.

## Moving Code Around
As we're writting code, we'll realize that we want to move the locations of lines and functions. Instead of cut and pasting the code, IntelliJ offer alternative ways of moving it.

### Moving lines
```
Alt + Shift + ↑
Alt + Shift + ↓
```

### Moving blocks of code
```
CMD + Shift + ↑
CMD + Shift + ↓
```

### Line duplication
```
CMD + D
```

## Navigating the Codebase:
As engineers we spend more time reading code than writing it. Because of this, it's important that we know how to search our codebases to find files, code usages, patterns, and etc.

### Finding files
```
Shift + Shift (Tap the Shift twice)
```
![Search All](gifs/search-all.gif)

### Finding classes
```
CMD + O
```
You should also know that IntelliJ will find multinamed
classes by searching for their acronym. 

E.g. Searching for "ST" will find "StringToken", "StreamTuple", etc.

### Find in path/files
```
Right-click on the package > "Find in Files" 
```

### Find usages
```
```
### Finding declarations
```
```
### Going back to the last spot
```
```

## Refactoring:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque eleifend elit et ex.

### Renaming
```
```
### Extract methods
```
```
### Introduce variables
```
```
### Inline methods
```
```

## Debugging:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque eleifend elit et ex.

### Breakpoints
```
```
### Evaluator tool
```
```

## Experimental code:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque eleifend elit et ex.

### Scratch files
```
```
